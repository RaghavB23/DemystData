## Problem 1 
Our approach dynamically generates a JSON specification for fixed-width file formats based on user input, enabling precise control over field lengths. It then leverages this specification to create and parse fixed-width data files, converting them seamlessly to a structured CSV format.

## Problem 2 
Our approach involves creating a Dockerized solution for processing and anonymizing CSV data using Python and Spark. The solution ensures portability, scalability, and ease of use by encapsulating all dependencies and logic within a Docker image.
